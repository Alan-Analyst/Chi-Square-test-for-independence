# Microchip Temperature Test Analysis

## Introduction

This repository contains the code and data used to perform a Chi-Square test for independence to test association between survival status and passenger class in the sinking of the Titanic accident. The goal of this analysis is to determine whether there is a significant association between pclass and survival.

## Prerequisites

To run the code in this repository, you will need the following software and libraries:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- NumPy
- SciPy
- Matplotlib (for data visualization)


## Results
The analysis results are presented in the Jupyter Notebook and include the following:

- Hypothesis testing for Chi-Square test for independence.
- Calculation of the test statistic, p-value, and rejection region.
- Interpreting the result.
